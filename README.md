# Algorithms_Engineering
Algorithms implementation in C++ to:

* Compute Fibonacci Number derived from the definition, using linear memory, and using constant memory 
* Compute the maximum number of floating-point operations (FLOPS) per second on a machine in single-threaded mode
* Solve Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem 
* Compute the memory bandwidth
* Unit testing in three situations

(More specific instructions for each algorithm can be found in the .pdf file in the same folder)
